# Config

This repository contains my configuration files for various tools and applications.
Since I just changed my laptop, I decided to start from scratch and document my configuration files in a repository, in case I need to set up a new machine or reset my current one.

## Currently included configurations

### ZSH (with Oh My Zsh)

- `.zshrc`
- `aliases.zsh`  ( ➡️ $ZSH/custom/aliases.zsh )
